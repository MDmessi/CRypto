Theory
Malicious logic encompasses a range of harmful software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, and 
other forms of malware. In this section, we delve into the theoretical foundations of malicious 
logic. We explain how malware spreads and operates, including its methods of infection, 
replication, and payload delivery. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind creating and 
distributing malicious software, as well as the techniques used by cybercriminals to evade 
detection and exploit vulnerabilities.
